# **Employee at Risk!** ðŸ“Œ

Here is my notebook on the classification problem of predicting the employees at risk, working with the dataset

# **Importing the libraries**

**Hello everyone**,
â€‹
This is my take on the binary classification of determining employees who are at a risk of termination or not.

â€‹
It is a Binary Classification Problem. The tools used are:

â€‹
**Pandas** for data manipulation and ingestion

â€‹
**Numpy** for multidimensional array computing

â€‹
**Matplotlib** and seaborn for data visualization

â€‹
**Word Cloud** for geeting the most populare string

â€‹
**Imblearn** for oversampling of the model

â€‹
**Scikit** Learn for Data Preprocessing


# For modelling:
â€‹

**Random Forest** Classifier:
â€‹
> Accuracy Reached: **95.74%**

â€‹
**XG Boost** Classifier:
â€‹
> Accuracy Reached: **93.17%**
â€‹

**Light Gradient Boosting**:
â€‹
> Accuracy Reached: **91.10%**
â€‹

**Cat Boost** classifier:
â€‹
> Accuracy Reached: **95.74%**


-> Feel free to leave any *suggestions* in the comments for the betterment of the notebook.
